# Free Experience APPs
## What is this repo?

The Free Experience APPs is an initiative to gather and create mobile apps and games that are both payment free (both paid and freemium) and free from advertising.

## Motivation
## Why I created it?

While paid and ad-revenue are completelly valid, We feel that games and apps targeted towards children and people in certain situations should not only be available throught ad-ridden or pay-first experiences. We are in no way against a company or developer being paid for their work, however large or small the company is, this is in no way an attack against people building ad-revenue games and freemium apps and we do not condone criticizing or using our work against them.

This is an attempt to fight back against predatory app developers that create ad filled aimed apps towards children to extract ad revenue, that create add filled apps towards poor and eldery people who have no options or knowledge to avoid these experiences.

## Rules

### 1:  The MUST NOTs part
1. The app must be fully free from charge, it means no requiring upfront payments nor having freemium features
2. The app must have no ads whatsoever, especially not from ad networks, and no third or firts party adds
3. The app must be fully functional without payments, including freemium models and [nagware
4. The app must have no malware, I know this goes without saying, but please don't

### 2. the IT WOULD BE BEST IF IT DIDN'T part 
4. it's prefereable if the app don't require registration, but we understand it can be a valuable part of an apps feature
5. it's preferable if the app to not have an email/phone subscription model, in the sense the user needs to subscribe to a mailing / texting list to use the app
6. it's preferable if the app don't have specific user tracking, especially invisible user tracking, such as unnecesarely tracking user habits or what the user enters in the apps inputs

### 3. the WE ARE OK WITH THIS part
8. app analytics such as vexo, sentry and googles/apple built in analytics are ok (but it'd be great if the users are warned about it)
9. non-advertisement announcements and asking for OPTIONAL donations is OK
10. attaching the  app to your company or porfolio is OK, like we stated above,  developers are not expected to work for free.

## Disagreements
We encourage people that disagree with this stance to create alternative lists with the best paid apps or the best freemium apps, there are many good options out there with those models.

## App review and addition
Submiting, Reviewing the apps will be a trust based process, you can either create  a PR if you are technically inclined OR submit an Issue

## App submission and review
Submiting, Reviewing the apps will be a trust based process, you can either create a pull request (PR) if you are technically inclined OR submit an issue with the app details. I'll do my best to review them, or if this gets any traction, have other trusthworty collaborators.

## After review and removal
If the app gets changed to a state where it stops fitting the rules, anybody can submit a pull request (PR) or an Issue
