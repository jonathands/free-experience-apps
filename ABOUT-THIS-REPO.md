# Free Experience Apps

## What is this repository?

Free Experience Apps is an initiative to gather and create mobile apps and games that are both free of charge and free from advertising.

# Motivation

## Why this was created

While paid and ad-revenue models are completely valid, we feel that games and apps targeted at children and people in vulnerable situations should not be exclusively available through ad-heavy or paid experiences. We are in no way against companies or developers being compensated for their work, regardless of company size. This is not an attack against people building ad-supported games and freemium apps, and we do not condone criticizing or using our work against them.

This is an attempt to counter predatory app developers who create ad-heavy apps targeting children to extract ad revenue, and who create ad-filled apps targeting people with low income or elderly users who lack options or knowledge to avoid these experiences.

## Rules

### 1: Required Criteria

1. The app must be completely free of charge, with no upfront payments or premium features requiring payment
2. The app must contain no advertisements, including those from ad networks or any third-party or first-party sources
3. The app must be fully functional without any payment requirements, including premium features and nagware
4. The app must be free from malware and malicious code

### 2: Preferred Criteria

5. Registration should not be required, though it may be acceptable if it provides essential functionality
6. Email or phone subscription requirements should be avoidedâ€”users should not need to subscribe to mailing or texting lists to access the app
7. User tracking should be minimal, particularly avoiding unnecessary tracking of user behavior or input data

### 3: Acceptable Practices

8. Standard app analytics (such as Mixpanel, Sentry, and platform-provided analytics) are acceptable, preferably with user notification
9. Non-commercial announcements and optional donation requests are acceptable
10. Developer attribution and portfolio/company branding are acceptable

## Disagreements

We encourage people who disagree with this stance to create alternative lists with the best paid apps or the best freemium apps. There are many good options out there with those models.

## App submission and review

Submitting and reviewing apps will be a trust-based process. You can either create a pull request (PR) if you are technically inclined, or submit an issue with the app details. We will do our best to review them, or if this gains traction, involve other trustworthy collaborators.

## After review and removal

If an app is modified in a way that no longer meets the criteria, anyone can submit a pull request (PR) or an issue.
